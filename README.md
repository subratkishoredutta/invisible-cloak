# invisible-cloak
a simple image processing based idea implemented using opencv.

this involves basic image processing and provides an insight to the basic operation involved in image processing

first of all run the masking.py and get the threshold values for the H,S, and V channels that would be used for creating a mask for the cloak.
for reference watch the video masking_py.mp4 how to create the mask. just run the code and adjust the trackbar and after the perfect mask is created just read the value of the corresponding trackbar

after that run the code GS.py for the image processing to begin

few insights:
1. basic bitwise operations like AND and NOT are involved
2.no deep leaarning or machine learning is involved
3.the concept is same as how green screen works
